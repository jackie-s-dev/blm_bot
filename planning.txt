BLM_Bot

To be written in Python

The bot will add views to a YouTube video which will donate to Black Lives Matter.
The bot, after viewing the video, will find 4 random videos and comment messages
promoting BLM to help the algorithm with discovery. The bot will run indefinitely
until the user tells it to stop.

There should be a simple GUI so that any person can allow their accounts to be
used to promote BLM.
